        <h1>History</h1>
       <p>The brigadier is made from condensed milk, chocolate and butter, and rolled in sprinkles. Ingredients aside, the candy has an unusual origin. It became popular in the 1940s when rationing made condensed milk a common substitute for desserts.
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>The story states that, around this time, women sold the treat at rallies in defense of Eduardo Gomes, presidential candidate and Air Force brigadier, during the first national election in which all women were able to vote.       
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>Women began to unite for voting equality in the 19th century. The efforts of suffragist entities, such as the Brazilian Federation for Women's Progress, led by scientist, future UN delegate, and politician Bertha Lutz, gained strength when women gained the right of voting in Europe and the United States. After decades of struggle, Brazilian women were able to vote in 1932.       
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>However, there were restrictions: only married women who had their husband's permission, single women who received their own salaries and widows were allowed to vote. This affected women's political participation.
       </p>
       As the Oxford Human Rights Hub, an international human rights organization, notes, “extending the vote to women in Brazil was a way of including them in the public sphere, while ensuring that the private sphere did not suffer any loss”. Thanks to continuous efforts in the fight for equality, voting became mandatory in the country for everyone between 1945 and 1946.

       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>At that time, the National Democratic Union (UDN) was formed, which opposed the populist regime of Getúlio Vargas, at the end of the Estado Novo. The new party's first presidential candidate was Eduardo Gomes. But before his candidacy, he was already famous in Brazil. Known as “the Brigadier”, he participated in a movement led by lieutenants who advocated social reforms.       
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p> In July 1922, a group led a revolt at Copacabana Fort, in Rio de Janeiro. Almost everyone was shot dead on the beach, except Gomes and Antônio de Siqueira Campos.
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>Gomes entered politics, rallied against populism and became the face of a movement aimed at dismantling it. In 1945, while running for president, he also demonstrated that he was not committed. One of the campaign slogans was: "Vote for the brigadier, who is handsome and single."
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>Gomes carried out fundraising before the election, and women in Rio de Janeiro's political sphere were crucial in the campaign. At rallies, they sold pieces of condensed milk with chocolate, and called him brigadeiro. It's a story that many Brazilians grow up hearing. But the origin of the candy is disputed by some stories, and it may just be a legend.
       </p>

       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>Either way, the main ingredient of the sweet is a creation from that period. Condensed milk was invented to sterilize the pre-cooling of milk and became indispensable in times of war, particularly during the First and Second World Wars.
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>According to the publication Words Without Borders, the Second World War created a deficit in imports of products that were essential for desserts at the time (such as fruits and nuts), so sweets began to be made with what was available.
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>The brigadeiro may have been invented before the 1940s, but Nestlé started selling condensed milk and chocolate powder in Brazil in that decade. Along with Gomes' candidacy, the company's advertising helped the treat take off.
